To run rails console on the production server: bundle exec rails c production

bundle exec rake RAILS_ENV=production [whatever] 

For mysql rake db:drop kills the whole database (not just dropping the tables); less obvious for sqlite

mailtrap start
tail -f /var/tmp/mailtrap.log



--- production logging ---

ActionController::Base.logger = Logger.new {STDOUT}
ActionController::Base.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG

ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new {STDOUT}
ActiveRecord::Base.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG



can do same thing with activerecord

in console, do

app.get 'topics/'

To create remote tracking branches:

Update: The same can be accomplished with a single command, which sets up remote tracking as well:

$ git checkout -b local_branch_name remotes/origin/remote_branch_name

This makes it so you can work with that branch (do merging, etc) locally.

git branch --track feature1 origin/master
Branch feature1 set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/origin/master.

undo a commit: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/git-undo-last-commit
git reset --soft HEAD^

see changes on a branch vs master: git log -p master..other-branch-name

git diff ...otherbranchâ€”diff from common ancestor (merge base) to the head of what will be merged. Note the three dots.
